The goal of this repo is to convert problems to their highest possible density. I believe a tool that could do this would help computational systems logically solve problems that are given in natural language.

Example of goal:
```
input_sentence = 'A block of mass 5.0 kg is pushed across a horizontal surface by a horizontal force of 20 N. If the frictional force between the block and the surface is 8.0 N, what is the acceleration of the block?'
---
answer = 'Solve for acceleration: mass=5.0;force=horizontal_force - friction_force; horizontal_force=20;friction_force=5'
```
